# WeatherPy
Week 6 Challenge

## Purpose

* Use the weather description data you've already retrieved in this module to enhance the PlanMyTrip app (work assignments from class). 
* Have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. 
* The beta tester will choose four cities from the list of potential travel destinations to create a travel itinerary. 
* Using the Google Maps Directions API, create a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer map.
